# MongoDB Storage for Dashboard
![Test suite status](https://github.com/userdashboard/storage-mongodb/workflows/test-and-publish/badge.svg?branch=master)

Install this module to use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data storage.

You will need to launch with additional configuration variables:

    STORAGE=@userdashboard/storage-mongodb
    MONGODB_URL= mongo://localhost:27017
    MONGODB_DATABASE="my_database"

You can use this storage for a module:

    MODULE_NAME_STORAGE=@userdashboard/storage-mongodb
    MODULE_NAME_MONGODB_URL=mongo://localhost:27017

To test this module use [Dashboard](https://github.com/userdashboard/dashboard)'s test suite configured with this storage engine.

# Dashboard

Dashboard is a NodeJS project that provides a reusable account management system for web applications. 

Dashboard proxies your application server to create a single website where pages like signing in or changing your password are provided by Dashboard.  Your application server can be anything you want, and use Dashboard's API to access data as required.

Using modules you can expand Dashboard to include organizations, subscriptions powered by Stripe, or a Stripe Connect platform.
